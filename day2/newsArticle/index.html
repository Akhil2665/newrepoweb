            ISRO’s SpaDeX docking experiment postponed to January 9</h1>

            <h2>The docking of the two Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) satellites scheduled for January
                 7 has been postponed to January 9.</h2>
            <p>“The SpaDeX Docking scheduled on 7th is now postponed to 9th. The docking process 
                requires further validation through ground simulations based on an abort scenario
                 identified today. Stay tuned for updates,” the ISRO said in a post on Monday (January 6, 2025).</p>
            <h2>Docking process</h2>
            <p>The ISRO was scheduled to carry out the docking experiment of the two small satellites,
                 SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target) in the early morning of January 7.
            </p>
            <p>The postponement of the docking experiment by two days is not a cause of concern
                 if the experiment is executed within the window that lasts till January 10.
                After the satellite launch, U.R. Rao Satellite Centre Director M. Sanakaran
                 said the docking is expected between January 7 and 10 
            </p>
            <h3>Why this mission is very important for ISRO?</h3>
            <p>With the SpaDeX mission, the ISRO aims to exhibit technologies needed 
                for spacecraft rendezvous, docking, and undocking using two small satellites
                 which have been mastered by only an elite group of spacefaring nations.
                The demonstration of this technology is essential for futuristic missions
                 such as sending an Indian astronaut on the Moon, sample return from the Moon, 
                 the building and operation of the Indian Space Station
